  The second kaggle competition I've participated just ended yesterday, unfortunately due to a wrong selection of the submission and bad local cross-validation strategy, I ended up in the top 14% without any medals. But I have learned so much from this competition and also from others kagglers. And since this competition a.k.a 'busines problem' can be replicated somehow somewhere in the real world, I decided to write a summery report of the features and the take away of this competition.
 
#### 1. Problem formulation

<br><br>
  This Instacart market basket analysis competition aimed to predict **which product will a user buy again over time**. The business problem here could be translated into 'Can I know my customer well enough to prepare a grocery list in their account so that they don't have to manually add them next time?', and related to that, but a bit out of scope of the competition, we can also find out the favorite product of client or the potential product that the customer will like.
  
  *[Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) is a grocery odering and delivery app based in US.*

  In general, the dataset contains the history of the transcational information of when a user has brought which product.

  Full dataset shema is as followed : [source](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b)

`orders` (3.4m rows, 206k users):
* `order_id`: order identifier
* `user_id`: customer identifier
* `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (see `SET` described below)
* `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth)
* `order_dow`: the day of the week the order was placed on
* `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day the order was placed on
* `days_since_prior`: days since the last order, capped at 30 (with NAs for `order_number` = 1)

`products` (50k rows):
* `product_id`: product identifier
* `product_name`: name of the product
* `aisle_id`: foreign key
* `department_id`: foreign key

`aisles` (134 rows):
* `aisle_id`: aisle identifier
* `aisle`: the name of the aisle

`deptartments` (21 rows):
* `department_id`: department identifier
* `department`: the name of the department

`order_products__SET` (30m+ rows):
* `order_id`: foreign key
* `product_id`: foreign key
* `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart
* `reordered`: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise

where `SET` is one of the four following evaluation sets (`eval_set` in `orders`):
* `"prior"`: orders prior to that users most recent order (~3.2m orders)
* `"train"`: training data supplied to participants (~131k orders)
* `"test"`: test data reserved for machine learning competitions (~75k orders)

#### 2. The approach 

  Since the evaluation metric of the competition is F1-score and the purpose is to predict the item that users will reorder again, my approach is feature engineering + logloss-xgboost model + F1-optimisation.

* Feature engineering (frequency/distribution and interaction based features)

  The features are generated as the following categories:
  
  * Product/aisle/departement features:
        
      Product-wised: 
      1. how many users has ordered this product
      2. how many users has reordered this product
      3. user reorder ratio of this product : #1 / #2
      4. how many times this product has been ordered
      5. how many times this product has been reordered
      6. product reorder ratio: #4 / #5
      7. product reorder probabilty : numbers of products has been purchased the second time / numbers of products                                         has been purchased the first time
      8. mean add to cart order of product
      
      Aisle-wised:
      1. how many times this aisle has been ordered
      2. how many times this aisle has been reordered
      3. aisle reorder ratio: #1 / #2
      4. mean add to cart order of aisle
      
      department-wised:
      1. how many times this department has been ordered
      2. how many times this department has been reordered
      3. department reorder ratio: #1 / #2
      4. mean add to cart order of department
            
      
  
  * User features:
  
  
  
  
  * User-product features:
